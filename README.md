## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides the details of Bhoj App which is the online food and groceries delivery. It helps the servive-provider to know if their customers are satisfied with their services. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. 

Since, the average rating is almost 4 so it is doing well in its service. 



### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present ".
- Step 4 : For calculating average sales, null values were not taken into account as only less than 1% values are null in this colum
- Step 5 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 6 : Visual filters Slicers,cards,piechart,treegraph,donut chart,funnel chart,matrix table were added. 
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           Although, by default, while calculating average, blank values are ignored.
